The accept_dad sysctl seems to always default to 1 inside a nspawn
container, no matter what its set to outside of it.

This is probably a legit issue (systemd or kernel). This code is
a workaround.

Small binary that remounts /sys/proc to rw, tweaks accept_dad settings
and then remounts to ro. Why did I bother writing this in c? Hell if
I know...
